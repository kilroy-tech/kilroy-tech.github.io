# Quickstart Guide

## Platform Requirements

Kilroy is a free application download for desktop and laptop computers, designed to be cross platform and portable.
It runs on most desktop architectures, with applications available for the following desktop platforms:

- macOS on Apple Silicon
  - macOS on Intel - *coming soon*
- Windows 11
- Linux (Ubuntu) - *coming soon*

Kilroy is designed to be scalable and can be run in headless server environments. Builds are available for
Intel/AMD, ARM, and ARM7, allowing it to run on anything from a Raspberry Pi to large, multi-host enterprise installations.
Because of the slightly customized nature of these environments, this version is only available for Docker upon request.

- Docker and Docker Compose - *available upon request*
