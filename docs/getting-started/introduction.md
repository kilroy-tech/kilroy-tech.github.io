# Intro to Kilroy

## What is it?

Kilroy is a single desktop application that lets you take control of your Internet, AI agents, apps, and social interactions. 
It gives you a way to combine all of these into a personalized, decentralized view that you can build and extend. Kilroy runs downloadable "apps" and agent
"pipelines" to provide unique functionality that is fully customizable. There's no need for messy command line installations, or stitching together dozens of services to make it work. It runs "out of the box" and you use Kilroy to extend Kilroy.

## Privacy and Security

Kilroy is based on the concept of "swarms", which you can think of as very private, peer-to-peer chats between any number of your Kilroy
apps, friends, or cloud services. Swarms are self-organizing, meaning that you don't need to have a static IP address, fixed domain name, or edit
any of your firewall rules, port forwarding definitions, or other network configurations to use them. They just work. Any two Kilroy apps using the
same swarm name to communicate are instantly talking with an end-to-end encrypted connection with NO servers in between.

Your data stays local to your computer. All of your Kilroy-related keys and passwords are stored in your local operating system's secure key storage.
Your identity is guaranteed, but also kept private unless you choose to share it with other Kilry users.

Kilroy can create a completely serverless, peer-to-peer social network of friends, family, co-workers, AI agents, and apps, where you control who participates
and what is shared.

## Your Personal Internet

Kilroy is whatever you make it. If you are a developer, it's a great platform for rapidly developing apps with full-featured user interfaces and access to 
a powerful library of pre-built functionality. And you can always extend Kilroy using its ability to dynamically load apps, including Javascript you provide,
or connect to local or remote web services.

If you are a power user, Kilroy's drag and drop programming environments produce "data-driven" applications. These apps can be shared with others, uploaded
to Kilroy app stores, and monetized using Kilroy's built in support for blockchain operations.

Anyone can easily download Kilroy apps and pipelines, connect them together in new ways, and create a personal agent platform that delivers *their*
Internet content to their desktop, phone, or any other Internet connected device or service.

## Agents and Apps

The official Kilroy app store has dozens of free apps, available to download and install in Kilroy. Some of them include:

  - **kilroy.ai.services** : a full-featured platform for developing AI-driven pipelines using a 100% visual editor. Connect your local or cloud LLMs
  to tools and services provided by Kilroy, make agents that talk to and from services like Telegram and Discord, pull data from applications on
  your local computer and power AI decision making, automate devices in your home. 

  - **kilroy.exchanges** : apps and AI tools for interacting with over 100 centralized exchanges. Automate trading strategies, manage your investments,
  integrate AI into your finances.

  - **telegram.services** - create your own bots for the Telegram instant messaging platform, feed data to and from local LLM agents, access your local
  desktop on the go from Telegram on your mobile device.

  - **kilroy.webwidgets** - build a local dashboard that shows all of your favorite Web content in a single view. Create instantly accessible views of
  live data. Watch 10 YouTube streams at once. Combine web-based data with local Kilroy apps in a single view.

  - **kilroy.devtools** - access to Kilroy's low code/no code editors for building Kilroy apps and pipeline tools. A block-based programming environment with
  full access to Javascript internals, plus an easy-to-use interface builder makes it possible to develop and share full-featured Kilroy apps without
  knowing a programming language. Power users and developers can use these tools to build custom integrations to new functions and services inside or outside
  of the Kilroy application.
